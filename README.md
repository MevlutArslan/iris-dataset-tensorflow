# iris_dataset_tensorflow
Learning tensorflow with the iris dataset.

Project finished, I think

1. The model might find the data very easy to learn and hence extremely high accuracy extremely fast

2. I messed up big time and need to asses.

I will try to use the model in diffent datasets to see which is the case
